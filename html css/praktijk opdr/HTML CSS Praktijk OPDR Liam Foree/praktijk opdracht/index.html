      <div id="text1" class="textbg grow text1" >
        <div class="textblock fonttext">In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight.
          <br>The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning "to pull, to draw".
          <br>Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as "engines")
          <br>though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units.
          
          <br><br>Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons.
          <br>Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. Most trains operate on steel tracks
          <br>with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport.</div>

<div id="text2" class="textbg grow text2">
        <div class="textblock fonttext">Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by
          <br>horses or pulled by cables. Following the invention of the steam locomotive in
          <br>the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing
          <br>freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before.

          <br><br>Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of
          <br>people in and around cities. Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following
          <br>World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of
          <br>motive power. Following the development of cars, trucks,
          <br>and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility,
          <br>as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share,
          <br>and many rail lines were abandoned. The spread of buses led to
          <br>the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.</div>

        <div id="text3" class="textbg grow text3">
          <div class="textblock fonttext">Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to
            <br>their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport.
            <br>High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances.
            <br>Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to
            <br>promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century. Freight trains remain important for the transport of
            <br>bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks.</div>
